### Abstract:
In various domains such as medical diagnosis and fraud detection, imbalanced datasets pose significant challenges, often leading to biased predictions favoring the majority class. Dynamic Classifier Selection (DCS) has emerged as a powerful strategy to address this issue by adaptively choosing the most suitable classifier for each data instance based on local performance estimates. This paper investigates the effectiveness of three prominent DCS techniques—Overall Local Accuracy (OLA), Local Class Accuracy (LCA), and META-DES (META-learner for Dynamic Ensemble Selection)—in the context of imbalanced datasets. A comprehensive evaluation involving 20 real-world datasets with diverse imbalance ratios is conducted, incorporating validation and hyperparameter tuning of base classifiers before integrating them into DCS frameworks. Evaluation metrics include F1 scores and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), complemented by visual representations. Results indicate that LCA and META-DES consistently outperform OLA across various levels of class imbalance, highlighting the crucial role of DCS algorithms in improving classification accuracy in imbalanced data scenarios.
